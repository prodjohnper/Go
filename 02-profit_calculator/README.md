# Profit calculator

### In this project we:

- Built a simple profit calculator that handles user input for revenue, expenses and tax rate. It also calculates earnings before tax (`EBT`) and earnings after tax (`profit`).

### I learned how to:

- Build a `profit calculator`
- Calculate `EBT` (earnings before tax), `profit` (earnings after tax), and `ratio` (between `ebt` and `profit`)
